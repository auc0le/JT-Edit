The CoolLED1248 program controls color LED panels and uses .JT files.

However, it is horrible to edit these on the mobile phone.  This project aims to create a browser based editor to allow for computer based editing.

It should support manual manipulation of individual pixes in the 3 bit (aka 7 + black) color space, as well as importing jpg images (and rasterizing them down to 3 bit color), and exporting to JT format.

In the samples folder, You can use the sample jpg and sample color table to edit in photoshop then import into the tool to convert to JT format.

Todo:
1. Add support for importing / reading JT files.
2. Improve the color mapping for opening files down to 3 bit color.
